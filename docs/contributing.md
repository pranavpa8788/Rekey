# Contributing

If you're contributing for the first time, make sure to give [First contributions](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions) a read

## Code style and formatting

- This project follows [PEP 8 Style Guide for Python Code](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) and hence all contributions are assumed to follow these as well (although it's not a dealbreaker)

- You can check if you code follows PEP 8 guidelines using [pycodestyle](https://pypi.org/project/pycodestyle/)

	`pip install pycodestyle`

	`pycodestyle file_name.py`

- Note: Line too long messages are fine and can be ignored and this failing to follow PEP 8 is not a major problem as it can be fixed later. It is stated above only for better readability of code
